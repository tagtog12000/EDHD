Essentially distinct Hugenholtz diagrams for free energy.
This code generates all linked and essentially (unlabeled) distinct vacuum Hugenholtz-type diagrams of free energy up to arbitrary order using many-body perturbation series.
The output results are shown as lists of integers which present the sites of suitable vertex of each diagram with its symmetry factor.
